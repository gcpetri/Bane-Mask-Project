# Technical Challenges

1. Offline Translator

The Bane Mask should be able to translate no matter the internet connection status and in the most remote parts of the world. Nearly all available translater software tools require an internet connection.

2. Materials Research

Finding the best materials to make the Bane Mask lightweight yet military protection grade will prove difficult. Furthermore, with the OLED screen attached to the front of the mask, the materials must be extra-lightweight and have a balancing mechanism so it will not fall forward off the nose.

3. ASL translator

Having a live speech to ASL translator and display will be challenging. The speed at which people talk will be tough on the performance of the display.

4. Hardware

Building an advances speech-to-text translator into a small device will be challenging. The amout of disk and RAM storage to make the device performant will be difficult and perhaps impossible.

5. Wearable

Creating the Bane Mask to be wore not as a burden is the most important challenge. The design must be comfortable and cool (allowing air-travel) but protect against air-borne disease transmission... the reason people began wearing masks in the first place.
