# Impact Statement

If the Bane Mask can make people excited about wearing masks our mission is complete.

The technology implemented in the Bane Mask is always advancing, thus, if we can stay on the pinnacle of the translation, portable screen, and light-weight, duratable material technology, our mask will be revolutionary. 

We want people to be able to travel to lands where the don't know the language. We want military personel to not worry about wounds on their face, want deaf people to be able to understand the general population, and want COVID numbers to decrease. 

If one of these goals can be seen through, the Bane Mask is on its way.

### Measuring

In the scope of the remaining semester, if our 3D model generates excitement around the classroom then we will have sucess because we know the product is desired.
