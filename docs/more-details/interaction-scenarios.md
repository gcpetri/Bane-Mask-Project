# Interaction Scenarios

1. User travels to a country where the language is not know to him or her. They need directions to get a gas station but cannot communicate with a local because they do not have any signal. They put on the Bane Mask and can instantly communicate with the nice native.

2. User needs to communicate to a deaf relative their medical information for insurance purposes. There is not ASL translator available so the relative's procedure would have to be delayed. The user uses the Bane Mask to efficiently communicate to their relative all the details.

3. User is a commander in the military. He or she is wary of their troops face protection but won't purchase conventional balistic masks because it is hard to communicate with them in combat. They find that bane masks are protectice and offer volume enhancers so every troop can be heard. 

4. User is a commander in the military. He or she wants a way for his troops to communicate with one another on the battlefield. The commander finds that Bane Masks can not only protect his troops, but also allow him to add a communication ear-piece to connect all the masks of his battalion.

5. User is a commander in the military. His troops are stationed in a remote region of the world where the major of them do not understand the native tongue. The commander finds that Bane Masks can allow the troops to communicate with the locals without any effort or classes.

6. User is a teacher for deaf and non-deaf students. The teacher needs a way to communicate with all the students but does not know ASL. He or she uses the Bane Mask to project their voice to the whole classroom while the OLED screen displayed ASL graphics for the deaf students. 

7. User is a teacher. He or she struggles with the school's mask requirement and no microphone system. They find it is hard for the students in the back to hear them. The Bane Mask allows him or her to keep safe from viral infections yet enhance their volume simultaneously. 

8. User is travelor in a country where he or she does not understand the native language. They try to speak with locals but find that their dialect is not one he or she was expecting. They cannot figure out what language to use when using Google Translate. With the Bane Mask, the user can allow a local to wear the mask and translate into English, at least long enough for them to comprehend what langauage to translate English into from there.

9. User is a translator by trade. They want to learn a new langauge so they wear the Bane Mask to speak into a foreign tounge and hear the translation. After hearing common phrases in this new langauge, they pick it up in no time.
