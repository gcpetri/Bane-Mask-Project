# Milestones

This product, in production, would likely require years before the beta-version is released.

### The 5 Week Development Period

During the first week, we layed out the plan for our project, video, and website edits moving forward. 

During the second week, we created a base-line 3D prototype with Blender software.

During the third week, we wrote the outline for the video and shuffled through our footage from our last experience to discern what could be used in the final video.

During the fourth week, we added color and design edits to the 3D model.

During the fifth week, we put the video togther with iMovie. We also recorded the voice-over with a professional microphone. We also took a quick demo video of the 3D model and its features.
