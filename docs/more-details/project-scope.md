# Project Scope

What we can actually do before this semester is complete.

### Reality

The reality is that the semester is almost complete and the majority of the group is about to graduate. 

### What we'll do

Knowing this, we hope to develop a decent design of the mask.
We will likely make a 3D model of the mask. With a 3D model we can play with the materials and design, as well as animate demos of its translating and voice enhancement functionalities.
