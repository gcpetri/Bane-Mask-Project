# Bane Mask Intro

Let's discover **The Revolutionary Face Mask**.

## Concept

The <code>Bane Mask</code> changes the way we think about masks... not as a burden, as a smart gadget. 

### Features

The Bane Mask features
* Live voice and ASL translation display
* Large OLED display

## Motivation

Today people view their face masks as a burden to guard from viral disease. 

We want to flip the narrative and make masks a technological advancement.

### Motiviation 1

**Mask Burden**
Masks today require people to yell to communicate and don't allow deaf people to read lips.

### Motiviation 2

**Traveler Language Barrier**
Seperately, travelers to foreign countries often only choose to visit a place where they can understand the language. If they travel to a country where they do not know the language they must rely on their smart phones, requiring an international data plan to slowly translate their words into the native dialect.

### Motiviation 3

**Miltary Moves**
The US miltary is stationed around the world, numerous countries for which the soldiers station know not the langauge. Moreover, the miliary does not have an advanced face protection armor.
